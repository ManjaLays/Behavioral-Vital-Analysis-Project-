# Behavioral-Vital-Analysis-Project-
This project focuses on the development of a smart system that monitors both physical and mental health aspects of immobilized patients. Using vital signs like heart rate, body temperature, and behavioral indicators such as sleep patterns and emotional state, the system provides continuous observation of patient well-being.
